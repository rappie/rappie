I'm Rappie, CTO & Lead Fuzzing Specialist at [Perimeter](https://perimetersec.io), Associate Security Researcher at [Spearbit](https://spearbit.com/), and active in bug bounty on [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/). I specialize in fuzzing EVM-based smart contracts to help protocols secure their code.

Beyond security research and protocol assessments, I contribute to the fuzzing community through open-source projects like [EVM Fuzzing Resources](https://github.com/perimetersec/evm-fuzzing-resources) and the [List of Public Fuzzing Campaigns](https://github.com/perimetersec/public-fuzzing-campaigns-list).
